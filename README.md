# Signals.ts

![Tests](https://github.com/cleverplatypus/signals-ts/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)


Signals implementation for TypeScript.

It's a simple pub-sub message bus architecture that's completely decoupled from any UI or other component.

Inspired by [JS-Signals](https://github.com/millermedeiros/js-signals) which was inspired by [AS3-Signals](https://github.com/robertpenner/as3-signals).

## Why another implementation
I used many implementations through the years, manly [Miller Medeiros'](https://github.com/millermedeiros/js-signals) one.

What I though was missing was:
- TypeScript support 
- Two way decoupled communication


## Installation

```sh
$ nvm i --save signals.ts
```
or

```sh
$ yarn add signal.ts
```

or
```sh
$ echo 'whatever package manager you use... the package is on npm.com ðŸ™‚'
```

## Basic usage

```ts
//signals.ts --------------------------
export const MY_SIGNAL = new Signal();
```

```ts
// dispatcher.ts ----------------------
import {MY_SIGNAL} from './signals';

MY_SIGNAL.dispatch();
```

```ts
// listener.ts ------------------------

MY_SIGNAL.add(() => {
  //do something about it
})

// or

MY_SIGNAL.addOnce(() => {
  //do something about it just the first time the signal is received
})
```

## Sending data

```ts
const SHOW_NOTIFICATION = new Signal<{title : string, body : string}>();

SHOW_NOTIFICATION.dispatch({title : 'Error', `There's a snake in your boot`});
```

## Receiving data (asynchronously)
```ts
const SHOW_DIALOG = new Signal<{title : string, body : string, buttons : Array<'ok' | 'cancel' | 'yes' | 'no'>}>();
```

```ts
// the enquirer
const [response] = //response are always an array
  await SHOW_DIALOG.dispatch({title : 'Danger', body : 'This button will destroy the world. Do you want to proceed?', buttons : ['yes', 'no']})
```

```ts
// the dialog view component
SHOW_DIALOG.add((config) => {
  return new Promise(resolve => {
  this.show(config)
    .onResponse(resolve)
  });
})
```

## Controlling propagation
```ts
//any failed response, according to the listenerSuccessTest will stop propagation
const APP_WILL_CLOSE = new Signal({propagate : 'any-fail', listenerSuccessTest: val => val === true})
```

```ts
// The app controller
const responses = await APP_WILL_CLOSE.dispatch()

const shouldProceed = !response.some(dirty => dirty = false)


// any listening editors

APP_WILL_CLOSE.add(() => {
  if(this.inABadMood) {
    return false;
  }
});

```

## Retaining early signal dispatchment

```ts
export const APP_WAS_INITIALIZED = new Signal({memoize : true});
```

```ts
// app bootstrapping controller

await this.bootstrap()
APP_WAS_INITIALIZED.dispatch();
```

```ts
// some component we're not sure will be listening in time

// listener will be called even if addOnce is called after the 
// signal was already dispatched
APP_WAS_INITIALIZED.addOnce(() => {
  this.doSomething()
})
```
